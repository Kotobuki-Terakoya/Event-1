computational thinking is an approach to solving problems using concepts and ideas from computer science

Decomposition ------
Takes a complex problem and breaks it into more manageable sub-problems. 
Ex: mulching a yard

Although solving the complex problem as a whole may seem very difficult, 
the solution to each sub-problem may be much simpler 
by putting together the solutions to the sub-problems.
Ex: aerial satellite photos
