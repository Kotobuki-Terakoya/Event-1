Decomposition ------------------------------------------------------------
Takes a complex problem and breaks it into more manageable sub-problems. 
Ex: 
We want to organize an event where children & adults will come and experience machine learning, while having fun.
Maybe we can break it into more manageable sub-problems:

Problem 1: Designing a session that makes people enjoy learning
Sub-problem: Define what can we teach them
    - What skills/knowledge do we have and want to teach
    - Estimate if people would be interested in learning about this topic
Sub-problem: How to make it enjoyable
    - Get the opinion of someone who is used to interacting with children

Problem 2: Organizing the venue (time, location, participants accomodation...)
Sub-problem: Decide on a time
Sub-problem: Decide on a location
Sub-problem: Plan for potential accomodations

Problem 3: Getting people to be interested and come to the session
Sub-problem: Advertise the session

NOTE: If breakdown of problems is done well, it also allows to:
- organize roles between members
- find what kind of people we would like to volonteer with us.


Pattern recognition ------------------------------------------------------------

Think of a problem for which you could use computational thinking, describe it, and then describe how you would apply pattern recognition.
